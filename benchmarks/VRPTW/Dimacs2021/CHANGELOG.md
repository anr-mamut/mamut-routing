# Changelog — Dimacs2021 BKS

All notable changes to the curated `Dimacs2021` best-known solutions (BKS) are recorded here. Objective: **mono-cost** (minimize total cost only). Distances use the DIMACS-2021 metric: coordinates scaled by 10 and arc costs truncated to integers, so costs are exact integers and comparisons are exact.

## 2026-06-15

Re-scraped the [SINTEF TOP VRPTW website](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/vrptw/) and **re-evaluated the SINTEF hierarchical solutions under the Dimacs2021 metric** (coordinates ×10, truncated integer distances). Although these solutions are optimized for SINTEF's hierarchical objective, several of them — once measured by the DIMACS integer cost — turn out to be cheaper than our pyvrp/HGS mono-cost BKS. They were adopted only where strictly better. All improvements are at `n=1000`, keep the same fleet size, and lower the integer cost:

Total cost reduction: **−3412** across 15 instances. Margins are small (all < 0.16 %) but exact: each is a strict integer improvement under the DIMACS metric. Solutions were validated with `mamut-routing-lib` (`check_solution`, including time-window feasibility under the integer metric) and adopted only when strictly better (`is_better_solution`).

### Metadata

- Removed the non-portable `source_path` field from every `Dimacs2021` BKS. It referenced a path inside the (not-yet-public) scraping repository and carried no value for downstream users. Provenance is still captured by `source`, `authors`, `date`, and `notes`.
